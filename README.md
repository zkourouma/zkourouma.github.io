Software engineer from New York City. After graduating from Columbia University
I worked for an investment bank as an equity desk-based analyst. Realizing my
favorite aspects of work were building tools and analyzing data, I taught myself
Python and pursued web development. Now I code primarily in Ruby with JavaScript,
SQL, HTML, and CSS.
