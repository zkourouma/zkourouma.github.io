	  a brief history
	</h3>
<p>
  After graduating from Columbia University I worked for an investment bank as
  a desk-based analyst. Realizing my favorite aspects of work were building tools
  and analyzing data, I taught myself Python and pursued web development.
</p>
<p>
  I got my first taste of startup culture working at Handybook as a developer in test.
  Handybook is a company based in New York that uses Ruby on Rails. My role there was to
  run the RSpec test suite and work with the engineers to fix any bugs that were found.
  This was a great learning experience for me because it gave me an inside
  perspective of the development process as well as insight into the responsibilities
  of being a full time web developer. Although my role was essentially an internship
  it confirmed my hypothesis that software could be my future.
</p>
<p>
  Now I am back to my Python roots working as a developer at Yipit. Coding in Python and
  using Django, I've worked throughout the stack during my time here. We use MySQL and Redis
  and, like most modern websites, use JavaScript and JQuery on the frontend.
  One of the best experiences I've had at Yipit was turning the monolithic Django
  app into a service oriented architecture (SOA). This was my first project and
  and really taught me valueable lessons regarding API design, client interfaces,
  and web front-ends. I've really enjoyed server-side development and feel most
  at home adding features to our API. One of my favorite features was Elasticsearch
  aggregations. Another awesome project I've worked on here is our iOS app. We
  decided that PhoneGap would allow us to leverage our web dev expertise and iterate
  quickly on a platform we had not dealt with. I couldn't have chosen a better
  way to start out and I'm sure the experience will prove invaluable in the future.
</p>
<p>
  On the side, I have an interest in machine learning as well as dipping my toe
  into systems programming. Although different in many ways, I enjoy the
  intersections of mathematics, computing, and getting different systems to play
  nicely with each other. Machine learning is fun because there are so many insghts
  that come from crunching the data. Systems engineering is also interesting, but
  for for the allure is in taking something apart and seeing how it works inside.

          A business analytics platform that accepts basic information from
          financial statements and produces relevant financial metrics. Along with
          financial computations, the app also takes historical data and renders
          charts with forecasted data.

                A terminal game with four modes: human (guesses) vs computer
                (picks word), human (guesses) vs human (picks word), computer
                (guesses) vs human (picks word), and computer (guesses) vs
                computer (picks word). The computer uses some simple probability
                and a list of words to guess letters.
            </li>
            <li>
              This project was a lot of fun not only because of the game, but
              because of all the interesting data that I generated testing the
              CPU vs. CPU mode. I found that four letter words are the hardest
              to guess because there are so many of them and that the longer the
              word is the easier it is to guess because the probability of
              certain letters being in specific positions narrows it down even
              further.
